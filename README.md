# [WIP]ML-2022-001-Glass_classification
Work in progress.

As a warm up and exercise I picked this a small real data set that requires minumum data cleaning to make EDA and apply some classification models.

Planned to do:
- ~~EDA~~
- ~~Applying various models and calculate the errors~~
- ~~Creating new features and apply the models again to observe the progress~~
- Choosing the models and altered data sets
- Fine tuning the models
